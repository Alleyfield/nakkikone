	<h3>Brief description of every Nakki:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Ticket Sales</strong>: You will sell tickets and count every sold ticket.</li>
	<li><strong>Kiosk</strong>: You will sell/give refreshments. This is the most hectic Nakki.</li>
	<li><strong>Cloackroom</strong>: You will take peoples jackets and stuff and mark them properly so that you can find them later and you will make sure nobody steals anything from hte cloakroom</li>
	<li><strong>Bouncer</strong>: There's usually just few Bouncers in a party who get paid for their work. They make sure everybody has great time and they know what to do in emergency situations.</li>
	<li><strong>Light Controller</strong>: You control the lights. You should come to build up the party because you get to know where all the lamps are and to test and program how they work.</li>
	<li><strong>Building up</strong>: The Nakki starts when we can get in to the rented place. This Nakki includes building up the sound and light technics, making food for the technicians, making decorations and putting then in place. This nakki can take 6-8h. At this point we need lost of people.</li>
	<li><strong>Taking down</strong>: The Nakki starts when the party is over. We pack everyting up and carry everything back to our warehouse. This includes cleaning up the place so that it will be at the same condition as when we got in. This takes about 4-5h.</li>
